# Open Higgsfield AI — Open-Source Alternative to Higgsfield AI

> **The free, open-source alternative to Higgsfield AI.** Generate AI images and videos using 200+ state-of-the-art models — without the closed ecosystem or subscription fees.

Open Higgsfield AI is an open-source AI image, video, and cinema studio that brings Higgsfield-style creative workflows to everyone. Powered by [Muapi.ai](https://muapi.ai), it supports text-to-image, image-to-image, text-to-video, and image-to-video generation across models like Flux, Nano Banana, Midjourney, Kling, Sora, Veo, and more — all from a sleek, modern interface you can self-host and customize.

**Why Open Higgsfield AI instead of Higgsfield AI?**
- **Free & open-source** — no subscription, no vendor lock-in
- **Self-hosted** — your data stays on your machine
- **200+ models** — text-to-image, image-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video
- **Extensible** — add your own models, modify the UI, build on top of it

## ✨ Features

- **Image Studio** — Generate images from text prompts (50+ text-to-image models) or transform existing images (55+ image-to-image models). Switches model set automatically based on whether a reference image is provided.
- **Video Studio** — Generate videos from text prompts (40+ text-to-video models) or animate a start-frame image (60+ image-to-video models). Same intelligent mode switching as Image Studio.
- **Cinema Studio** — Higgsfield AI-style interface for photorealistic cinematic shots with pro camera controls (Lens, Focal Length, Aperture)
- **Upload History** — Reference images are uploaded once and stored locally. A picker panel lets you reuse any previously uploaded image across sessions — no re-uploading.
- **Smart Controls** — Dynamic aspect ratio, resolution, and duration pickers that adapt to each model's capabilities
- **Generation History** — Browse, revisit, and download all past generations (persisted in browser storage)
- **Image & Video Download** — One-click download of generated outputs in full resolution
- **API Key Management** — Secure API key storage in browser localStorage (never sent to any server except Muapi)
- **Responsive Design** — Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile with dark glassmorphism UI

### 🖼️ Image Studio — Dual Mode

The Image Studio automatically switches between two model sets:

| Mode | Trigger | Models | Prompt |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Text-to-Image** | Default (no image) | 50+ t2i models (Flux, Nano Banana, Ideogram, GPT-4o, Midjourney…) | Required |
| **Image-to-Image** | Reference image uploaded | 55+ i2i models (Kontext, Seededit, Nano Banana Edit, Upscaler, Background Remover…) | Optional |

### 🎬 Video Studio — Dual Mode

The Video Studio follows the same pattern:

| Mode | Trigger | Models | Prompt |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Text-to-Video** | Default (no image) | 40+ t2v models (Kling, Sora, Veo, Wan, Seedance, Hailuo, Runway…) | Required |
| **Image-to-Video** | Start frame uploaded | 60+ i2v models (Kling I2V, Veo3 I2V, Runway I2V, Wan I2V, Midjourney I2V…) | Optional |

### 🎥 Cinema Studio Controls

The **Cinema Studio** offers precise control over the virtual camera, translating your choices into optimized prompt modifiers:

| Category | Available Options |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cameras** | Modular 8K Digital, Full-Frame Cine Digital, Grand Format 70mm Film, Studio Digital S35, Classic 16mm Film, Premium Large Format Digital |
| **Lenses** | Creative Tilt, Compact Anamorphic, Extreme Macro, 70s Cinema Prime, Classic Anamorphic, Premium Modern Prime, Warm Cinema Prime, Swirl Bokeh Portrait, Vintage Prime, Halation Diffusion, Clinical Sharp Prime |
| **Focal Lengths** | 8mm (Ultra-Wide), 14mm, 24mm, 35mm (Human Eye), 50mm (Portrait), 85mm (Tight Portrait) |
| **Apertures** | f/1.4 (Shallow DoF), f/4 (Balanced), f/11 (Deep Focus) |

### 📁 Upload History & Picker

Every image you upload is saved locally (URL + thumbnail) so you never upload the same file twice:

- Click the upload button to open the **reference image picker**
- Previously uploaded images appear in a 3-column grid with thumbnails
- Click any thumbnail to instantly reuse it — no API call needed
- Upload a new image with the "Upload new" button in the panel
- Remove individual images from history with the ✕ button
- History persists across browser sessions (stored in `localStorage`)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- A [Muapi.ai](https://muapi.ai) API key

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Anil-matcha/Open-Higgsfield-AI.git
cd Open-Higgsfield-AI

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. You'll be prompted to enter your Muapi API key on first use.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## 🔌 API Integration

The app communicates with [Muapi.ai](https://muapi.ai) using a two-step pattern:

1. **Submit** — `POST /api/v1/{model-endpoint}` with prompt and parameters
2. **Poll** — `GET /api/v1/predictions/{request_id}/result` until status is `completed`

Authentication uses the `x-api-key` header. During development, a Vite proxy handles CORS by routing `/api` requests to `https://api.muapi.ai`.

File uploads use `POST /api/v1/upload_file` (multipart/form-data) and return a hosted URL that is passed to image-conditioned models.

## 🎨 Supported Model Categories

| Category | Count | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Text-to-Image** | 50+ | Flux Dev, Nano Banana Pro, Ideogram v3, Midjourney v7, GPT-4o, SDXL |

- **Muapi.ai** — AI model API gateway

## 🤔 How is this different from Higgsfield AI?

Higgsfield AI is a proprietary AI video and image generation platform. **Open Higgsfield AI** is a community-driven, open-source alternative that provides similar creative capabilities without the closed ecosystem:

| | Higgsfield AI | Open Higgsfield AI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | Subscription-based | Free (open-source) |
| **Models** | Proprietary | 200+ open & commercial models |
| **Self-hosting** | No | Yes |
| **Customizable** | No | Fully hackable |
| **Data privacy** | Cloud-based | Your data stays local |
| **Source code** | Closed | MIT licensed |
